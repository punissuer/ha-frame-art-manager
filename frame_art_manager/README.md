## About

Home built web interface for managing artwork destined for Samsung Frame displays. Upload images, organize with tags, and sync your library with Git LFS for backup and multi-device management. TV assignment and scheduling now live in the Home Assistant integration—this add-on focuses on curating the artwork library itself.

## Installation

1. Add this repository to your Home Assistant add-on store:
   - Go to **Supervisor** → **Add-on Store** → **⋮ (menu)** → **Repositories**
   - Add: `https://github.com/punissuer/ha-frame-art-manager`

2. Find **Frame Art Manager** in the add-on store and click **Install**

3. Configure the add-on (see Configuration section below)

4. Start the add-on

5. Click **Open Web UI** or add to your dashboard

## Configuration

Configuration options are available in the **Configuration** tab of the add-on.

**Default values:**
```yaml
home: ""
frame_art_path: /config/www/frame_art
port: 8099
```

### Option: `home`

Friendly label for the household or physical location this add-on instance manages (for example `Madrone`). The field is optional today but will let future releases target site-specific automations.

### Option: `frame_art_path`

The directory where your artwork library will be stored. Default is `/config/www/frame_art` which makes images accessible via Home Assistant's built-in web server.

### Option: `port`

The port the web interface will run on. Default is `8099`.

**Note**: The add-on uses Ingress by default, so you can access it directly from the Home Assistant UI without worrying about the port.
